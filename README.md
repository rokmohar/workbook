About

You create your own profile. You can search for people you know
and you can connect with them by sending them a friend request. They
have to accept your request and then they are added to your friends
list. You can organize them into circles for connecting with them easier

photos, external content (e.g. blogs, web sites, youtube videos, etc.).
