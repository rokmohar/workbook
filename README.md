WorkBook
========

About
-----

WorkBook is a social-network web application for connecting with
your co-workers, family memebrs and friends.

You create your own profile. You can search for people you know
and you can connect with them by sending them a friend request. They
have to accept your request and then they are added to your friends
list. You can organize them into circles for connecting with them easier
and faster.

You can add different kind of posts to your profile, from text messages,
photos, external content (e.g. blogs, web sites, youtube videos, etc.).
You can set privacy for each post and limit its visibility only to selected
group of people (e.g. everyone, selected circles, selected individuals).

You can react to and comment posts from people you are connected with.
