About
-----

WorkBook is a social-network web application for connecting with
your co-workers, family memebrs and friends.

You create your own profile. You can search for people you know
and you can connect them by sending them a friend request. They have
to accept your request and then they are added to your friends list.
You can organize them into circles for connecting with them easier
and faster.

You can add different kind of posts to your profile, from text messages,
photos, external URLs (e.g. blogs, web sites, youtube videos, etc.). You
can set privacy for each post and limit its visibility only to certain
people (e.g. everyone, your friends, only selected people).

You can react to and comment your posts and posts from the others.
